# OO Basics: Student


# I worked on this challenge with Abid Ramay & Robin Soubry
# This challenge took us [1.5] hours.

=begin
Release 1: Create an Array of Students
Create an array students with 5 Student objects (HINT: You'll need to create the student objects first). Each student should be assigned a first_name, and 5 test scores (scores are between 0 and 100) when it is created. The first Student should be named "Alex" with scores [100,100,100,0,100]. Once you've done this properly, the Release 0 tests should pass.

Release 2: Average Scores
Compute and assign a score average and a letter grade to each student. Letter grades are based on the average (A for >=90%, B for >=80%, C for >= 70%, D for >= 60% and F for < 60%).

Release 3: Linear Search
Write a linear_search (Links to an external site.) method that searches the student array for a student's first_name and returns the position of that student if they are in the array. If the student is not in the array then the method should return -1.

Release 4: Binary Search
Write a binary_search (Links to an external site.) method that searches the student array for a student's first_name and returns the position of that student if they are in the array. If the student is not in the array then the method should return -1. You can write a iterative (or recursive, if you are comfortable with that) version of binary_search.

# Pseudocode
=begin
Input: The class 'Student' takes two arguments: name (string) and scores (array with 5 numbers)
Output: There are 3 different methods:
  * average: Returns the average score for a particular student in the student-list
  * letter_grade: Returns the a score from A-D + F, based on the average score of a student.
  * linear_search: Checks if the student exists in the student-list.
Steps:
  * Step1: Define a class 'Student'
  * Step2: initialize the new class with 3 instance variables:
    - @first_name: Takes value from the 'name' argument
    - @scores: Takes an array of 5 numbers from the scores argument
    - @grade: Is pre-defined with an empy string
  * Step3: Calculate average
    - Sum up all elements in the score-array and divide that value by the number of elements in the array
  * Step4: Define letter grade: Return a letter, based on the average score of the student:
      IF average >= 90 return A
      IF average >= 80 return B
      IF average >= 70 return C
      IF average >= 60 return D
      IF average < 60 return F
  * Step5: Define a linear_search method that checks if a string exists as a first name in the collection of 'students'
      FOR EACH student in students, RETURN 0 IF the name to check matches the firstname of a student ELSE -1.

# DRIVER TESTS GO BELOW THIS LINE
# Initial Tests:

p students[0].first_name == "Alex"
p students[0].scores.length == 5
p students[0].scores[0] == students[0].scores[4]
p students[0].scores[3] == 0


# Additional Tests 1:

p students[0].average == 80
p students[0].letter_grade == 'B'

# Additional Tests 2:

p linear_search(students, "Alex") == 0
p linear_search(students, "NOT A STUDENT") == -1

# Reflection

What concepts did you review in this challenge?
  We reviewed following concepts in this challenge:
  * Instance variables
  * Creation of a class with pre-defined parameters or parameters set with initialize
  * Iterations with each
  * The reduce method to sum up elements of an array
  * Accessing named objects and array elements.

What is still confusing to you about Ruby?
  I'm still not very familiar with reader / writer methods and accessor elementsâ€¦
  I understood the logic during week-6, but I'm not sure if we have used it properly in thi schallenge.

What are you going to study to get more prepared for Phase 1?
  Review challenge 6.4 'Accessing attributes'
