##What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?##
Web Design has __six__ distinct phases

1. _Information Gathering_: During the information gathering phase, you try to obtain as much relevant information as possibe about the purpose of the site, the goals you wnat to achieve with it (ie. make money, amuse people with cat pics or be informative), who the target audience will consist of and what kind of content you will provide

2. _Planning_: In the planning phase, you structure the site by making a list of all topics or subtopics and by structuring them in logical navigation blocks. You can represent this work with a sitemap

3. _Design_: Make a skin (graphical look and feel) of the site. Try to keep your target audience in mind when choosing colors, fonts etc.

4. _Development_: This is when you will write the actual code

5. _Testing & Delivery_: In this phase you will thoroughly test your code compared to the initial plan. It's a good practice to test the different links and try to render the pages in different browsers.

6. _Maintenance_: In the maintenance phase, you will incorporate technological changes that may be required (ie. new dimensions for facebook pictures) or fix bugs that may have surfaced past the delivery phase.

##What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?##
My site's main purpose is to give a complete image of myself, both as an individual as well as a professional. I want to take advantage of website's flexibility (compared to a static resume) to provide a more complete and nuanced reflection of myself. As the sitemap illustrates, I will do this by creating:
* a regular one pager about myself
* showcasing previous work in a portfolio
* writing blogposts about my three passions: Business, Technology and Adventure

##What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?##
My target audience consists of 2 groups:
* __People interested in my writing or adventures__: Because I aim to touch three distinct topics (business, software and adventures), I will create a "dispatch" page with an introduction to the different subjects, so that the reader will be easily redirected to what interests him/her most.
* __Recruiters__: With my very generalist profile, I would like to showcase both my business as technical skills towards recruiters. In the sections "About Me" and "My Work", I will try to give a complete and nuanced image of who I am. If the recruiter would like to digg deeper in my take on certain aspects of business or technology, the recruiter can contiue reading on the blog.


##What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.##
* __Blog readers__: Get dispatched to the right sub-blog, so they are exposed only to the relevant topics.
* __Recruiters__: Obtain a snap image of my profile. This will be most prominent in the "About Me" section of the site.


##What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?##
User Experience is NOT a "one size fits all"! What holds true in life can also be applied to design: People are different, have distinct needs and expectations, and you won't be able to make everyone happy. Therefore it's important as a designer to obtain a profound understanding of the of the goals of your design as well as the target audience that will interact with your application and adapt the look and feel (colors, font size, etc.), the tone of voice, media types etc to this audience. This does not mean however that you should think about your application in terms of narrow user groups. If for example you would design an application for a public service (ie. a Library), you should apply various techniques of "Inclusive Design", to make your design work for the largest audience possible (ie. by extensively applying semantic html5 tags and meta-info for screenreaders).


##What is user experience design and why is it valuable?##
User Experience design is a set of principles aimed to make users of an application interact more easily with a (computer) interface. These principles help the designer to:
* Create a logical navigation of a site (or an individual page)
* Pick suitable fonts, color-pallettes, images according to the user group
* Etc.

There are various techniques to help the designer in this role:
- Creating user scenario's or persona's
- Test (and track) real user behavior on different versions of a design to see what work's best for the purpose of the design
- Content mapping (and structuring in a sitemap)
- Mock-ups and prototyping tools to quickly validate ideas with a client or user
UX is a very valuable aspect to a web development process because it can make or break the project with the end user. After all, if the end user does not see the benefit, or doesn't know how to perform a specific task on a platform, there is no need to develop it in the first place! Next to soft and intangible optimizations for the user's experience, UX can also boost the revenues of a platform (ie. check-out flows of e-commerce websites or sign-up processes for online casino's)


##Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?##
I found learning the markdown language very frustrating and time consuming. The language itself is pretty simple and straightforward, but the designer behind [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) has given priority to a minimalist look & feel of his/her website, which made reading through it really painful. _Quite ironic to experience this on a site that explains the language was designed for extreme readibility._
