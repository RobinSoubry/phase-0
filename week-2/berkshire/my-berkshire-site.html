<!-- 
1. What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  I thought that it was helpful to translate what we learned with HTML into an actual site because we can see the code that we have been learning come to life. It is also helpful because we can see when we make a mistake. 
  
2. How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  We didn't really use semantic HTML5 elements. We just did some research on Ampersand. 
  
3. How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  We often checked our code using HTML Validation Tool. Also we saved in sublime often and refreshed the site. 
  
4. What seems good and bad about HTML?
  Something bad is that you can't really do any formatting, something good is that it's really structured on where to put everything (like videos, pictures) and it's easy to understand even for beginning coders.
  
5. What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  Some tricks for remembering is to make sure we have the HTML skeleton all set up before we add more details and complexity. Also remembering to open and close all tags before inserting content. Keeping notes for important HTML syntax would be helpful as well.
